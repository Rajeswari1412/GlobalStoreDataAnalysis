# GlobalStoreDataAnalysis


For this project, I used SQL for data exploration and cleaning process and then export to Power BI to analyze sales data from random store's various locations and products. The project goal was to identify trends and patterns in the data that could help improve sales performance.

I created several visualizations to help me explore the data. These included charts and graphs that showed sales trends by location, product, and time period. I also created a dashboard that displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, quantity and Profit margin.

As I analyzed the data, I identified several areas where the store could improve its sales performance. For example, I noticed that certain products were selling better in certain locations than in others. I recommended that the store adjust its inventory levels and marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each location's customer base.

I also noticed that sales tended to dip during certain times of the year. I recommended that the company launch targeted promotions and discounts during these periods to encourage customers to buy more.

Overall, my project helped the company gain valuable insights into its sales performance and identify opportunities for improvement. The visualizations and KPIs I created in Power BI made it easy for stakeholders to understand the data and make informed decisions based on my analysis.
